# twin_smooth
Algorithms related to the computation of twin smooth integers.

This code was produced as part of my Master Thesis "Finding consecutive smooth integers by solving the Pell equation" in 2022.

I am currently working on an improved version of this (both from a mathematical and a programming standpoint) written entirely in PARI/GP, which will be released soon.
